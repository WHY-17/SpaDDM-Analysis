# Reproducibility of SpaDDM
This repository provides the complete codebase, datasets, and analysis scripts to reproduce the results presented in the paper. 
![SpaDDM workflow](https://github.com/WHY-17/SpaDDM-Analysis/blob/main/SpaDDM%20framework.jpg)
Since Moran'I is used in evaluating spatial clustering performance rely on the squidpy package, the squidpy toolkit needs to be installed first from https://github.com/scverse/squidpy.
The implementation scripts for all the results in the article are included in Code, including spatial clustering, spatial embedding, UMAP visualization, and computation of evaluation metrics.
The results of intercellular signaling flow network inference and transhistological translation can be obtained from Cross-omics translation, intercellular flow network inference, respectively.
We have uploaded some of the data used for intercellular signaling flow inference to zenodo (https://zenodo.org/uploads/15681100), which can be downloaded and used. Moreover, we have presented the existing results in Results.
