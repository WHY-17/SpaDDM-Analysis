# Reproducibility of SpaDDM
This repository provides the complete codebase, datasets, and analysis scripts to reproduce the results presented in the paper. 
![SpaDDM workflow](https://github.com/WHY-17/SpaDDM-Analysis/blob/main/SpaDDM%20framework.jpg)
  Since Moran'I is used in evaluating spatial clustering performance rely on the squidpy package, the squidpy toolkit needs to be installed first from https://github.com/scverse/squidpy.
  The implementation scripts for all the results in the article are included in Code, including spatial clustering, spatial embedding, UMAP visualization, and computation of evaluation metrics.
